# 3D-Graphics-Renderer
A modelling application that uses .MD2 model to render those models.

This application is built using C++ and makes use of an existing (BaseFramework) code base that was not written by me.

Every file that handles the model, rasterisation, lighting, matrices, vertices and transformation was written by myself, with only the initial window being written by someone else.

You can run the application by opening the Standalone folder and running the .EXE. This will cycle through all methods of rendering the model with appropriate labels.
